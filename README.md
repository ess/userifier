# Userifier #

## Disclaimers ##

This is an attempt to make an alternative "shim" for Userify that may be usable on systems lacking an installed/usable Python (for example, CoreOS).

To that end, it's also my first foray into Go programming, so it's likely pretty bad, as far as code quality goes, and I'm just now learning the testing story (using ginkgo/gomega).

Also, this is very much an unofficial project (I work for EngineYard, but this one, for now, is mostly just a lunchtime proof-of-concept).
